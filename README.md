# MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Anomaly Detection

This project explores time-series anomaly detection using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. The primary focus is on detecting irregular heartbeats from ECG signals using unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches.

## Project Goals
- Load and preprocess MIT-BIH ECG data
- Build baseline anomaly detection models (autoencoders, statistical methods)
- Evaluate model performance using labeled beat annotations

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed ECG signals
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory and modeling notebooks
- `scripts/`: Data loaders, preprocessors, evaluators
- `models/`: Trained models and checkpoints
- `outputs/`: Results, logs, and figures

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress.
